# The Company

Fr-Admin was established in January 2021 by Emma Jones who offers administrative and computing
assistance to anyone either living, working, or regularly travelling between the UK and France.
Following the UK’s departure from the EU in January 2020, Emma realised that there was a need to
help expats, second homeowners and businesspeople to navigate the myriad of confusing paperwork and
rukes and regulations that formed part of this process.

Emma’s unique selling point is her ability to work across many fields at expert level in both French
and English. Her 25 years’ worth of IT work experience and 8 years of living and working in France
mean that she is able to offer excellent administrative services to anyone with either a personal or
business interest in France and all things French. 

# The French Experience

After happily residing in rural Southern France with two small children and a large dog between 2003
and 2011, the Jones family eventually returned to the UK following the financial crash of 2008.
During their time in France, the family ingratiated themselves with the local community, renovated
and built two houses, schooled their two sons, taught English to French professionals, and assisted
other UK expats with their own projects and administrative challenges. The family were active in all
aspects of French life and made many close friends, this led to them being able to speak a high (but
not necessarily perfect) level of French. Since their return to the UK in 2012, they have continued
to maintain French friendships and have been back to visit their friends several times and will
continue to do so for many years to come. 

# Charlie

When they returned to the UK, complete with their French dog and his passport in 2012, they quickly
became aware of just how much they had grown as European citizens. Charlie had to be inoculated and
given his flea and tick treatments prior to departure and had paid many visits to French vets to
enable this to happen. Emma and the family had shared this journey together and they will happily
live with their French adventure memories forever.
