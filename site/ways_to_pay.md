title: Ways to Pay

## Bank Transfers and Paypal

As a small family run business, we like to maintain a personal relationship with clients, and so
strive to be flexible with our payment options.

**Direct Transactions** or **Paypal** are our preferred methods of payment as they keep things
simple for both parties. Once it comes to time to pay, we'll let you know where to credit our account. 
If you would like to negotiate another way to pay, please contact **enquiries@fr-admin.com**.

## Online Payments

We regret to inform that, for the time being, **we will not be accommodating online payments via the
site**.

Online payment systems involve a lot of technical infrastructure, such as a user account and 
storing payment details securely, and so on. While we may consider this option in the future, we
believe that the best way to keep your information safe and stay in line with the General Data Protection
Regulations, (GDPR) is to avoid needing to store your data at all.
