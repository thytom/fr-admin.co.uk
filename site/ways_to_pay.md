title: Ways to Pay

## Bank Transfers and Paypal

As a small family run business, we like to maintain a personal relationship with clients, and so
strive for flexible in our payment options.

**Direct Transactions** or **Paypal** are our preffered methods of payment as they keep things
simple for both parties. Once it comes time to pay, we'll let you know where to send the money. If
you would like to negotiate another way to pay, please contact **payments@fr-admin.com**.

## Online Payments

We regret to inform that, for the time being, **we will not be accommodating online payments via the
site**.

Online payment systems involve a lot of technical infrastructure, like a user account system,
storing payment details securely, and so on. While we may consider this option in the future, we
believe that the best way to keep your information safe is to avoid needing to store it at all.
