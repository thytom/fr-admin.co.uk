# Payment

## Bank Transfers and Paypal

As a small family run business, we like to maintain a personal relationship with our clients and strive 
to be flexible with our payment options. Once we have discussed and agreed your needs, we will 
send a breakdown of what we can do for you with a final costing. Where there is no 
definitive outcome, our rates for advice and assistance are **£15 an hour**. We do not charge for offering 
initial advice or signposting.

**Direct Transactions** or **Paypal** are our preferred methods of payment as they keep things
simple for both parties. Once it comes to time to pay, we'll let you know where to credit our account.


## Online Payments and Data Protection (GDPR rules)

We regret to inform that, for the time being, **we will not be accommodating online payments via the
site**.

Online payment systems involve a lot of technical infrastructure and while we may consider this option 
in the future, we believe that the best way to keep your information safe is to avoid needing to store 
your data at all. We will always request permission prior to storing any data and you can request that 
anything we do hold be removed at any time. When contacting us, we will only have your email address and
this is what we will use to contact you. If communications continue beyond your initial request, then we 
will ask for your permission prior to storing any further information about you, such as your name, address
and so on. Our systems are simple and this means that we can remove your data easily at any time. It also 
goes without saying that we will never share your data with a third party unless you request that we do this
on your behalf.
